# How to Use
Well... it's not finished yet but ready to use.

I will show you how to create a new page

open `views/markdown`
and create new file with format `.md`.
> WARNING: do not use special characters when naming files.

Open a new file and fill it with markdown

Example:
```md
---
title: Your Title
---

# Hello World
> Blockquote
[Link]({{{ config.info.site }}})
```

Now check by going to the url `http://your-web.com/article/filename`.

You can also custom css in `public/style.css`.

*Check `config.toml` file for global configuration*

*and `frontmatter` for inpage configuration.*

Example open [{{ attr.example }}]({{ attr.example }}).

To run server use
```bash 
bash main.sh
```

instead of 

```bash
npm start
```

if it's the first time.

And then, you can add anything you want like navbar :)

That's all for now.
